title: About Me
---

I am a three-year Ph.D. student at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk){:target="_blank"}, working with [Prof. Yun-hui Liu](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/people/list.php?name=yhliu){:target="_blank"} in the [CUHK T-stone Robotics Institute](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ri){:target="_blank"}. Since January 2016, I have been working with [Prof. Peter kazanzides](http://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Russell H. Taylor](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht/){:target="_blank"} as a visiting Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"} in the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing + Robotics](http://lcsr.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests are vision-based soft object manipulation, vision-based surgical tool tracking and control, and developments of robotic surgical components and systems, with emphasis on both scientific and engineering aspects. Being an awardee of the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html){:target="_blank"}, I will try my best to make my contribution to the academic research of Hong Kong. Prior to my Ph.D studies, I received B.E. at [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, China.

You can find the detailed information about me in my [curriculum vita](../zrwang.resume/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
